## How to launch the application on different platforms

# Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro** using **Expo**. To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the repository folder:

```bash
npx expo start

# if encounterimg issues
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## Step 2: Open the app

Either install Expo on your plateform. After scanning the QR code, the app will load and then open up.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running .

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
